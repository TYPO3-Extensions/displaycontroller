Tutorial
--------

This tutorial is designed not only to explain how the Display
Controller itself works, but – more generally – what the whole
Tesseract Project is about and what advantages it brings compared to
more usual ways of working with TYPO3.

The whole point of the Tesseract Project is to provide a set of tools
(extensions) that make it easy to retrieve data from a variety of
sources (but in particular the TYPO3 database) and display them in the
frontend without having to develop custom extensions every time.

In order to highlight the benefits of the Tesseract Project, this
tutorial was designed to show in the frontend a very unusual piece of
information: a list be BE users.

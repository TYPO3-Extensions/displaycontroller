Scenario
^^^^^^^^

Here's what we want to achieve in this tutorial: imagine a web site –
possibly an intranet – where we want to have a list of BE users
somewhere in the frontend, so that visitors can easily contact the web
site administrators.

This tutorial will show that this can be achieved with a minimum of
efforts and a minimum of redundant components. Future tutorials on the
Tesseract web site (http://www.tesseract-typo3.com/tutorials/) will take this example
further, e.g. showing how to search, sort and filter this list.

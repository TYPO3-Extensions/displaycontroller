This extension is a FE plugin for the Tesseract Project. It connects a
Data Consumer with one or more Data Providers and Data Filters in
order to display data in the TYPO3 FE.

If this sounds like gibberish please go straight to the Tutorial
chapter of this manual which explains all the basic concepts. For an
even quicker introduction you can refer to the tutorial screencast
found on the Tesseract web site (http://typo3-tesseract.com/).
